# TXT2EXCEL

I'm very glad you come and read.

This program just a simple format changer for TXT to EXCEL.

**It's useless for you with a high probability**

But you also can waste time on taking a look about `re` or `file-operate` in my code to avoid mistakes later.

## future

This program can read txt-files in a dir than get the KEY number after shuffle lines(just for randomness).

Each file will get same name sheet in .xls out.

File complete or not will print in command line.

## Usage

in command line :

`python program.py`

you can change `dataDir` , `re` and `NUMBER_OF_CLASS` where you need in `program.py` file.
